# RhymeIt
#HackISU Submission! It is a simple app that gives out the rhyming words!

## Inspiration
I wanted to successfully use an API and consume Restful Web services as I haven't worked on it before

## What it does
When you enter a word, it gives out a list of rhyming words

## How I built it
Mostly using Android Studio.

## Challenges I ran into
As I am new to android development, I had a hard time figuring out many things and it consumed a lot time.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Eventually I was able to make the app work.

## What I learned
I learned how to use APIs and web services. I am now confident that I can easily work with APIs and develop cool apps in long run. This is just a start!

## What's next for RhymeIt
Need to work on extra features like adding voice support, gaining additional insights about the words, etc!
